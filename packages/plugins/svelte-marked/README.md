# Magidoc - Svelte Marked

Svelte-Marked is a fully typed markdown parser inspired by [Svelte Markdown](https://github.com/pablo-abc/svelte-markdown) that renders markdown into Svelte components. 

Each component renderer can be overwritten with custom Svelte components, and extensions can be registered to support custom markdown syntax. 

> This library can be used in any Svelte or SvelteKit application.
