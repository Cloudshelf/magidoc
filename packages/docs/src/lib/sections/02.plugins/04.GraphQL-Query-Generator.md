title: GraphQL Query Generator
since: 1.0.0
tags: ['standalone', 'plugin']
---

> Info: This plugin is a standalone plugin and can be used outside of Magidoc. It was made so that it can be used both in a browser environment and with NodeJS. 

The GraphQL Query Generator plugin does exactly as its name suggests: it automatically build GraphQL queries and variables from a single root query type. Generating GraphQL queries requires complex logic that is abstracted by the generator. 

## Example of query
**Query**
```graphql
query ($delay: Int, $delay2: Int) {
  person {
    name
    age(delay: $delay)
    friends {
      name
      age(delay: $delay2)
    }
  }
}
```

**Variables**
```json
{
  "delay": 20,
  "delay2": 20
}
```

## Install

```bash
pnpm install -D @magidoc/plugin-query-generator
```

For ViteJS users or SvelteKit users, `prismjs` needs to be added to the `noexternal` dependencies. Here is an example for a `svelte.config.js`.

```javascript
export default {
  kit: {
    vite: {
      ssr: {
        noExternal: ['prismjs'],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Usage

PrismJS supports a [ton of languages](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages) out of the box. You can use any of these languages without any additional work. The plugin also exposes properties to display line numbers and a copy button. 

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Prism from '@magidoc/plugin-prismjs'
</script>

<Prism
  language={'javascript}
  source={`
    const x = 'best plugin ever'
    console.log(x)
  `}
  showLineNumbers
  showCopyButton
/>

```

## Themes
It is most likely that you will wish to customize the style of the code section, which comes out white by default. You can install any Prism theme by simply importing any CSS theme file in your svelte component. This theme will apply globally.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Prism from '@magidoc/plugin-prismjs'
  import 'style.css'
</script>
```
> Info: This website uses the PrismJS plugin to display code. If you like the theme used, it is a slightly modified version of the OneDark theme and is available [here](https://github.com/pelletier197/magidoc/blob/main/packages/docs/src/lib/components/common/markdown/prism-theme.css).

## Custom languages
Using a custom language is also a breeze. Most languages plugins will install themselves automatically, but PrismJS must be imported first. 

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Prism from '@magidoc/plugin-prismjs'
  import 'prism-svelte' // https://github.com/pngwn/prism-svelte
</script>
```
