> Info: This plugin is a standalone plugin and can be used outside of Magidoc itself. It is built to be re-usable outside of Magidoc for any Svelte or SvelteKit Project.

The PrismJS plugin is a Svelte plugin built with TypeScript that gives you to get syntax highlighting for displaying code inside the browser, using [PrismJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prismjs) under the hood.

## Install

```bash
pnpm install -D @magidoc/plugin-prismjs
```

For ViteJS users or SvelteKit users, `prismjs` needs to be added to the `noexternal` dependencies. Here is an example for a `svelte.config.js`.

```javascript
export default {
  kit: {
    vite: {
      ssr: {
        noExternal: ['prismjs'],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Usage

PrismJS supports a [ton of languages](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages) out of the box. You can use any of these languages without any additional work. The plugin also exposes properties to display line numbers and a copy button. 

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Prism from '@magidoc/plugin-prismjs'
</script>

<Prism
  language={'javascript}
  source={`
    const x = 'best plugin ever'
    console.log(x)
  `}
  showLineNumbers
  showCopyButton
/>

```

## Themes
It is most likely that you will wish to customize the style of the code section, which comes out white by default.
