# Welcome

Welcome to **Magidoc**! Magidoc a is a freww open source software that allows you to create static documentation website (like this one) for you GraphQL API.

## Preambule

Before we get started, it is important to understand that Magidoc is not actually a tool that will generate documentation, but will rather help you create your own website using a starter.
Using this approach, you will have the possibility to personalize entirely your website, using Typescript, any UI framework or any plugin you want, which is impossible to do with the other available tools out there.

Magidoc however provides many tools for you to customize your website out of the box.
