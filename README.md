  Fast and highly customizable GraphQL documentation generator. 
</p>


MagiDoc is an open source tool built from scratch that improves developer experience, provides more useful documentation and is more customizable than existing solutions. 

It can generate the static documatation directly from a GraphQL endpoint in a few seconds, and it supports markdown for the [SDL comments and documentation](https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/schema/documentation/) and the custom pages.

## Demo
